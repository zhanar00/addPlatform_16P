Ad platfrom

Introduction
This project is a web-based marketplace platform inspired by Avito. Users can register, create and manage product listings, browse items, and communicate with other users. The platform features a modern, intuitive UI and includes an admin panel for managing users and content.

Problem Statement

Many people face difficulties when trying to sell or buy used items online due to the complexity of platforms, lack of trust, and poor user experiences. Existing marketplaces often overwhelm users with ads, outdated interfaces, or confusing navigation. Additionally, newcomers may find it hard to promote their products effectively or protect themselves from scams. Our project solves these problems by providing a user-friendly, intuitive platform inspired by Avito, where users can easily register, create product listings with images and descriptions, and communicate with potential buyers or sellers. With built-in support for secure login, profile customization, and ad moderation, the application improves trust and simplifies the transaction process, making it accessible and safe for everyone, especially beginners in online commerce.
